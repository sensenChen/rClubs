rClubs (formerly RPI Clubs and Activities) is a website/mobile application where students can find when and where a specific club meets. 

To use this site, simply enter the name of one of your clubs in the search box and hit enter. The search engine will hopefully display the time and location of that particular club. Should the club not exist, you can notify us or fill out the information yourself and submit it to us.

But what if you want to take advantage of all the features our site has to offer? Simple. Just register for an account by clicking "Signup" in the top-right corner. All you need is a valid RPI email, which you will have to verify, and then you're all set! 

Once you're logged in, you can start saving clubs to your MyClubs list. That way, we can send you club-related notifications to your email.
